Comments: Microsoft reported an update was published for their Edge browser that fixes an issue with Edge importing open tabs from Google's Chrome browser without user consent. This was not a surprising discovery as the Edge onboarding experience appears to be specifically designed to get users to consent to automatic imports of data from other browsers. In stead of asking something like "Would you like to import your browsing data and history?" it says "Let's start by signing you in and bringing over your passwords, history, and more" followed by the option to "Make your Microsoft experience more useful to you", both of which allow Edge to harvest user data in perpetuity. These questions are deceptive in that they do not explicitly disclose what the user is consenting to. The way the questions are framed implies that Edge will not be useful to the user unless they give consent, which likely encourages users the give consent without consideration for privacy.
