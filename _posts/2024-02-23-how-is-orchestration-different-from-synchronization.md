Synchronization is about duplication and timing, whereas orchestration is about effort and effect. Syncing devices ensures they all perform the same task in the same way and at the same time. This generally limits synchronization to equivalent devices, such as a concerto of violins or a group of firewalls. Orchestrating devices ensures they perform their specific task in concert with all of the other associated devices in order to achieve a desired effect. It can be said that there is a great deal of synchronization that goes into orchestration.
