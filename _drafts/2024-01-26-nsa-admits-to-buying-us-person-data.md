Comments: The NSA admitted to buying records of American's internet activity from data brokers, a practice that usurps the Fourth Amendment rights of all US persons. Senator Ron Wyden (D, Oregon) called for an end to the practice by all intelligence agencies and urged them to inventory and purge data illegally collected without consent or warrant. The Department of Defense defended its data collection practices, stating that it adheres to high standards of privacy and civil liberties protections. In an attempt to regulate the data broker industry, the Federal Trade Commission issued a new order that requires "clear and conspicuous disclosures and informed consent before data can be sold to third parties."
